	 "Itchy and Scratchy" cartoons are often added when a show 
needs expanding or when there is an issue that the writers wish to 
satirize. The shorts are often hard for the writers and 
     take a long time (XyearsX) to develop and come up with a title for the short 
and in the end they do not fill up a large amount of time.<br></p> Writing the 
Itchy &amp; Scratchy cartoons is quite often a group 
    effort, with it being pitched out one gag after another. Itchy &amp;
 Scratchy are a favourite of John Swartzwelder, who has written many of 
the episodes that centre around them and quite 
    often pitches the ideas for the shorts.<b><a href="http://localhost:8080/">lala<</a></b></p> and so XdivX</div>
